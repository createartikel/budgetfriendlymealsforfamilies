- "50 g sugar"
- "3/4 teaspoon salt"
- "3 eggs"

- "1 thin glass or metal ring for cutting cookies with a diameter of 75 cm"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the fresh yeast a bit earlier from the refrigerator to make it warmer. Then mix warm milk, crushed yeast, 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of flour. Leave to rise for about 10 minutes covered with a cloth."
- "Put the rest of the flour in a large bowl, add sugar, salt and mix. Then pour the yeast mixture and start mixing the ingredients with a spoon. Add the eggs and mix again, then knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth."
- "Now keep adding soft butter, piece by piece, all the time kneading the dough for about 10 minutes, until it is flexible and shiny (don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s sticky). Cover the bowl with the dough with a cloth and set aside for 1 hour to rise."
- "Put the dough on a pastry board sprinkled with flour. Knead for a moment to get rid of the air bubbles. Join in one part, then spread the dough with your hands on the board (about 1 cm thick)."
- "Use a glass or rim to cut 15-20 circles. Flatten them a bit in your hand, put a full teaspoon of marmalade on the center. Fold the cricles in half, stick the edges, form a ball and put it in the paper cup (with the bond facing the bottom)."
- "Place on a baking tray and let stand for about 1/2 hour to rise. Preheat oven to 180C (360F)."
- "Cover the top of the donuts with a beaten egg previously heated at room temperature and put in the oven. Bake for approx. 15 minutes."
- "Remove from the oven, cool for about 15 minutes, then coat with frosting or confectioner&#39;s sugar."
