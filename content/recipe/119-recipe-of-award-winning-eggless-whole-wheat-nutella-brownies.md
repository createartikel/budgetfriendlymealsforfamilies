After successfully making an eggless version of my Easiest Nutella cookies, I decided to also try experimenting with making an eggless version of my Easy Nutella Brownies. These didn&#39;t work out quite as perfectly as the cookies, but they are still pretty good. The crumb is a little looser than I would. These brownies have an intense chocolate flavor and are perfect with a glass of milk Fudgy and oh so chocolaty Eggless Brownies! Enjoy them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top or a glass of milk!
