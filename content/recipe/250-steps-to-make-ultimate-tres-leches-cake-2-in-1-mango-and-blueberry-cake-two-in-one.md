A traditional Mexican cake scented with the flavors of a pina colada cocktail - pineapple, coconut and rum. Peach and Blueberry Pound Cake - the perfect summer dessert! My two favorite cakes in one. Tempted to soak the cake for just a few hours as a shortcut?

Yeah, we had that thought too, and we tried it in order to make this a one-day process, but the milk mixture didn&#39;t soak through completely. To get that classically decadent, milk-in-every-bite texture, be patient and let it sit. The blueberries and mango held up perfectly within the batter and the combination of the two is a match made in heaven. But one note: they taste WAY better after cooling completely - the flavors come out more. This white chocolate and mango cake is not for the faint hearted.
