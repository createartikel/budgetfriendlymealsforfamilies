Don&#39;t ask me why, because I LOVE sashimi and I had a lot of it in Japan! Serve this Spicy Salmon (Faux-kay) Poke on cucumber slices for an elegant hors d&#39;oeuvre, or spoon them into little squares of seaweed snacks to make poke I discovered Hawaiian poke (pronounced POH-kay) the first time we visited the paradise island. Traditional poke is essentially a sashimi salad. What happens when you hoard pickled ginger and there&#39;s sashimi grade salmon available at the market…Spicy Salmon Sushi Bowls!!

There&#39;s a restaurant in LA called Sugarfish and to say Thomas and I are obsessed would be an understatement. Their salmon rolls are the BEST and it&#39;s exactly. Diced salmon and avocado topped with slices of diced Japanese cucumber, kizami nori and served onto a bowl of sushi rice. A sprinkling of spring onions and ikura (roe) and spicy sauce brings a flavour explosion to this rice bowl. I made these spicy sockeye salmon poke bowls using the highest quality fish from Luxe Gourmets which So you don&#39;t have to wait another minute, this beautiful whole-side of salmon can be shipped overnight!
