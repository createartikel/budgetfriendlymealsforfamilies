If there are more than two cups of meat, great. Use a pair of good kitchen shears, a sharp chef&#39;s knife, or cleaver to chop up the carcass just enough so that you can lay the bones mostly flat. Homemade Chicken Soup may be the ultimate comfort food, and whenever I have a left over carcass &amp; bones, it&#39;s time to cook up a pot. It is soo EASY to make &amp; it&#39;s so much better than just tossing the bones.
