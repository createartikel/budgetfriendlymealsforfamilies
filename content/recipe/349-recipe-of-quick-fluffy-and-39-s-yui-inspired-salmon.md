You know that signature line by The Most Interesting Man in the World? Well, I&#39;m going to have to steal his meme for just a second here to say this. Arrange salmon rolls over sushi rice, sprinkle with sesame seeds or my favorite furikake seasoning and a few dashes soy (if you&#39;d like). I know this is not a classic poke bowl but it&#39;s a tasty meal even without the rice.

Salmon Flies and Fly Tying - the history and development of the Atlantic Salmon Fly, changing salmon fly patterns and modern trends in the design and tying The Atlantic Salmon, Salmo salar, the &#34;King of Fish&#34;, has inspired a rich history of salmon flies, a wealth of exquisite fly patterns, created over two.

Starting at the tail end, slip the blade of a long, sharp knife between the fish flesh and the skin, holding the skin down firmly with your other hand.
