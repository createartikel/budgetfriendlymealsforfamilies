recipeingredient:
- " The soup itself"
- " Little oil"
- "8 cloves garlic"
- "1 medium brown onion"
- "1 half tube or a smaller pack tomatoe puree"
- "2 jalapeos cut into pieces"
- " Dried chili flakes"
- "1 ish tbsp ground cumin"
- "1 tbsp coriander ground or dried"
- "Half tbsp ground chili"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "1 liter chicken stock"
- " Cayenne pepper"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " The toppings"
- "4 tortilla wraps"
- "200 g chicken breast  some spice u like"
- "1 avocado small diced add some lime juice to cover"
- " Grated cheddar cheese"
- "1 little sweetcorn"
- "Half bell pepper small diced"
- "Half red onion small diced"
- "1 bit of creme fraiche"
- " Fresh flat parsley or coriander for decoration"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the chicken breast: Cut the breast into like thinner (1cm) slices and coat it with some cayenne pepper, salt or I&#39;ve used a cajun spice and salt. Bake it in a pan on high heat to get some brownish color on both sides, make sure it cooked through. Finally, let it cool down meanwhile you can start the soup itself (later on cut the slices into pieces) this will be one topping unless you want veggie version."
- "For the soup base dice the brown onion and press or dice all the garlic. 8 cloves seems a lot but its not going to dominate the flavour so it&#39;s alright."
- "Put some oil on a medium heat and start cooking the onion and the garlic for a few minutes."
- "I&#39;ve de-seeded the jalapeños but it&#39;s up to you, just needs to be in pieces"
- "So after like 2 min when the onion got a little bit transparent, add the tomatoe puree, cumin, coriander, some salt, jalapeños, all the chilies, cayenne pepper and black pepper. It&#39;s going to be a quite thick paste, just cook it for further 4-5 minutes."
- "Add half liter stock to it and cook it for another 10 minutes and then using a hand blender blend it together to be as smooth as possible."
- "Finally add the other half of the stock to it and the bay leaf, boil a little bit more and the soup base is done."
- "You can use a sieve to make it even smoother if you like."
- "Cut the wraps into triangles and using a frying pan on a bit of oil bake them to be crispy and a bit brown. Be careful with the heat as it can burn quickly."
- "Cut up all the topping ingredients meanwhile you cook the soup or after that."
- "And finally your guests of family members can make their own topped version at the table. Start with the soup, not much needed (2,5 dl per person) as the garnishes will add some volume. And add chicken, avocado, corn, pepper, red onions, cheese and a bit of creme fraiche if you fancy and decorate it with a bit of parsley or coriander. You can also change the order how ever you like."
- "Just an end note: you can set the hottnes and spiciness with adjusting the amount of chili you add. If u like it milder then use less. ;)"
