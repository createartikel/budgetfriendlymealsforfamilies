I swap the sugar for honey and used agar agar in place of the cornstarch. This sweet-and-sour sauce is thin but flavorful--perfect with salmon. This is a lovely alternative to the typical grill/bake/broil method of preparing salmon. Warm the Thai Chili Sauce in the sauce pot. Using tongs, flip the plank, and then place a salmon on heated side of plank.
