This creamy crockpot mac and cheese starts with uncooked macaroni. Just throw the milk, cheese and seasonings in the slow cooker for a meal everyone will love! Mushy mac and cheese can also be the result of using gluten free macaroni noodles as they do not hold up as well.

##### The ingredients needed to make Easy crock pot Mac~n~Cheese:

1. Take 1 box pasta uncooked. (I use shells, they grab that cheese!)
1. Prepare 1/3 stick of butter
1. Take 1 can evaporated milk
1. Prepare 1/2 cup water or milk. If I&#39;m out of milk like today, water works just fine(: (I just fill the evaporated milk can half full)
1. Get 1 can diced tomatoes with juice. You can leave this out, but add about 1/2 cup more water or milk.
1. Take 4 cup of your fav grated cheese, yep 4! I used 2 cups cheddar blend, and 2 cups Velveeta shreds. I know..VELVEETA?!?! Sometimes that melty gooey cheese food weird stuff is ok..lol 1 block of cream cheese in place of 2 cups is heaven too.
1. Make ready 1 salt and pepper to your liking
1. Take 1 paprika sprinkled over the top


You need to make a cheese sauce while also cooking pasta in another pot. And you&#39;ll almost definitely feel the need to make a buttery topping and bake it (even though it was already perfectly. I have tried macaroni and cheese recipes in the Crock-Pot slow cooker before, but they always require you to boil the pasta ahead. I feel like if you are going to do this step, it&#39;s just as easy to bake the mac and cheeseâ€¦why involve the slow cooker?
