Sometimes I add cooked rice to give it a bit more substance. I love that courgettes add a real creaminess to soups when blended. Great if you&#39;re trying to cut down on adding cream to things or if you are vegan. I admit I don&#39;t really like cream in soups, I find it dulls down the flavours too much and if I&#39;m going to eat cream, I&#39;d rather eat it with a nice slice of pie thank.
