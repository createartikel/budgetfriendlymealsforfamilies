- "1 tsp sugar"
- "250 ml chicken stock I used Knorr stock pot"
- "150 ml dry white wine"
- "2 bay leaves"
- " Salt"
- " Ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat oven to Gas Mark 5 or electric equivalent (Circotherm 160)"
- "Prick the sausages with a fork and then brown with 1 tbsp of the oil in a casserole dish on the hob at a medium-high heat. Turn them a few times to get an even colour. Should take 8-10 minutes. Set the sausages aside for Step 6 and keep warm."
- "Fry the bacon just a few minutes, until just starting to brown but not burnt, and set aside with the sausages ready for Step 6."
- "Put the remaining oil into the casserole and fry the shallots and red onion for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and fry with the shallots and onions until they are all softened, occasionally stirring but gently."
- "Stir in the mushrooms, celery, pepper and chili and gently fry for a further 3-4 minutes."
- "Stir in the remaining ingredients except the liquid and seasoning. Then add the stock, wine and bay leaves. Stir thoroughly and carefully add back the sausages and bacon. Again, thoroughly stir and bring to the boil."
- "Cover the casserole and transfer it to the pre-heated oven. Cook in in the oven for 45-50 minutes until the sausages are well-cooked, stirring very occasionally. Check the volume of liquid a couple of times and add a little stock if - but only if - necessary to avoid the casserole drying out."
- "Season to taste (note that salt may well not be necessary given the ingredients but that’s a matter of taste), remove the bay leaves and serve onto warmed plates with your choice of hot accompaniments. A few new potatoes and French beans or peas and maybe a little extra carrot go well."
