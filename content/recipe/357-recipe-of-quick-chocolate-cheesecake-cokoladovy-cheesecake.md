I did channel my inner Jackson Pollack with some splatters on the top of my cake in dark, milk and white chocolate. Place the springform pan on a larger baking sheet (to catch any drips). Cheesecake Filling: Melt the chocolate in a stainless steel bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water. Add cream cheese, melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and sugar to a large bowl and whisk, either by hand or with an electric mixer, until all the ingredients are incorporated.
