Politiko is the &#34;bible of Philippine Politics&#34; being the most read all-politics news website in the country. Rick Stein&#39;s balık ekmek - griddled mackerel in a baguette with tomato, lettuce, onion, chilli and sumac. A delicious sandwich that&#39;s ubiquitous along the shores of the Bosphorus in Istanbul. This is a lot spicier and much more tangy with a heaver tomato flavor than the &#34;authentic&#34; tikka masala that I would get from an Indian restaurant.
