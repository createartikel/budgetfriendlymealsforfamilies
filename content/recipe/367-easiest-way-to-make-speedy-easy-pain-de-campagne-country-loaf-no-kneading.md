The rest of the ingredients remain the same.

- "Start to preheat the oven and a cast iron pot with the lid at 250℃."
- "Check the fermentation."
- "If the fermentation is OK, put parchment paper over the basket and put a cutting board and turn them over."

Flip the dough over, remove the basket, and lift and place the loaf in the Dutch oven by using the parchment as a sling (leave the paper under the dough). Cover the Dutch oven and place it in the hot oven. This easy Dutch Oven Pain de Campagne integrates two of my favorite bread-baking techniques - the BBA method, as outlined in the Bread Baker&#39;s Apprentice by Peter Reinhart, and the Forkish process, as presented in Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast by Ken Forkish. The resulting loaf is baked in a ceramic Dutch Oven to produce a delightfully crispy crust and an airy, but not too open, crumb.
