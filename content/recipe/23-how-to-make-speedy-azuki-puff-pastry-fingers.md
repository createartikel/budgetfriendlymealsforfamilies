Puff pastry is made from hundreds of paper-thin layers of butter trapped between hundreds of paper-thin layers of dough. A pastry scraper also acts as an extension of your hands and fingers, helping you manipulate the dough without warming it up too much with your hands. I cut the puff pastry sheets into three strips (they came folded that way, so I worked with it) and gently rolled them to widen them slightly. Place another sheet on top of the spinach mixture and using your fingers press down and seal the edges around the spinach, removing big air bubbles.
