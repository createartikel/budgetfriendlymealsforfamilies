recipeingredient:
- "350 g plain flour"
- "250 g fine semolina"
- "390 ml warm water"
- "10 g salt"
- "5 g sugar"
- "1 potato mashed 150g"
- "12 g fresh yeast or 7 g dried yeast"
- " Extra virgin olive oil"
- " Green olives to taste"
- "800 g fresh plum tomato"
- " Origano"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook and mash the potato and leave it to cool. Once cooled down, start working on the activation of the yeast. Mix the yeast in a little bit of water with some sugar. When the yeast is active add it to the flour, semolina, potato and 250 ml of water in a large bowl. Once all the ingredients are mixed, add the salt. Once combined and you have produced a nice dough, add two spoons of olive oil and keep working the dough."
- "At this point you should get a very elastic and hydrated dough. Split the mix in two and put it on two different oven trays which have been brushed with two spoons of olive oil each. Leave them to rise in a warm place for 2 hours."
- "After 2 hours flip the dough into 2 round focaccia trays which have been brushed with another two spoons of oil (I did not have them so I used square aluminium trays, they work fine also)."
- "With your finger push down being careful not to push the air out of the dough."
- "Break the tomatoes on the top of the focaccia and pus them on the top of the focaccia, add olives, 4 spoons of olive oil, salt and origano. Cook on a preheated oven at 250 degrees for about 25-30 mins."
- "The result will be sensational. Just make sure you use great quality ingredients, especially the olive oil."
