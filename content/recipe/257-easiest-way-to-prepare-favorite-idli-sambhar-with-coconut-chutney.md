Idli Sambar is an unbeatable combo, I love to eat idli with both sambar and coconut chutney. Attimes I love to dunk the idlis in sambar and enjoy my sambar idli that is my preference only now, during my childhood days I hate to mash up and eat. I love mini idli. there are several chutney recipes from the south indian cuisine palette. but without any doubt, coconut chutney is the king of all chutneys. perhaps the popularity of south indian breakfast recipes is complete without the existence of nariyal chutney recipe. hence i guess it is also known as idli chutney or. Sambar is a popular southern Indian dish made from daal(lentil), Imli (tamarind) and vegetables. Sambhar is enjoyed in breakfast, lunch and even dinner with other dishes like Idlis, Vada, pulihora, lemon rice, tomato rice and many more other dishes.
