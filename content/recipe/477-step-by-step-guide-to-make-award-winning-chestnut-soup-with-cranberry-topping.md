recipeingredient:
- "2 small onions"
- "80 g butter"
- "1 small piece knob celery ca 75 g"
- "200 g precooked and vacuumed chestnuts"
- "200 ml white wine"
- "150 ml cream"
- "500 ml vegetable broth"
- " salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel onions and dice. Braise in a pot with butter until translucent. In the meantime skin celery and dice. Dice also the chestnuts."
- "Add the celery and chestnuts to the onions, braise for a minute (or less) and deglaze generously with white wine. Let simmer for a couple of minutes. Add cream and broth. Let simmer for 20 min."
- "Put the soup in a food processor or or use a hand-held blender. Season with salt and pepper."
- "For the cranberry topping: wash and pat dry 250 g cranberries. Put in a small pot with 50 g sugar and 2 tbsp red port wine, stew for 5-10 min. Add 1-2 tsp balsamic vinegar. The sour taste of this topping perfectly balances the creamy slightly sweet soup. (The photo shows only half the amount of cranberries - for two servings.)"
