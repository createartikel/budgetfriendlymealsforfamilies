recipeingredient:
- " 450 g yellow lentil"
- "1/2 large brown onion"
- "1/2 large red onion"
- "3 or more small chillies"
- "3 sprigs curry leaves"
- "2 tsp full of chicken seasoning powder"
- " Knorr  maggie Brand"
- " Oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare all ingredients. Lentil/dhal is soaked for few hours before using. Drain the water."
- "Using food processor, grind/blitz lentils/dhal until almost smooth but it’s ok if some are still course. No water needed if using food processor. If using a blender, use small amount of water (few tbsp) and blend dhal in small batches. Add few tablespoon of rice flour if blended lentil is way too wet (that happens if water is added too much when blending). Finely mince the rest of the ingredients. Next, mix everything well (ground dhal, minced ingredients &amp; seasoning)."
- "Heat oil in a frying pan. Scoop desired amount and flatten it on your palm. Make them as thin as possible. It will break easily so gently slide them to hot oil. Leave them undisturbed in hot oil until lightly browned before turning once as they tend to break easily. Avoid crowding the pan. Deep fry to desired crunch. Remove from the pan once done and place on paper towel. Taste then adjust seasoning after the first fried batch. Serve as it is or with any desired dips and sauces."
