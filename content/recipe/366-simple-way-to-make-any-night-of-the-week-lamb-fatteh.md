In Arabic, the word &#34;fatteh&#34; literally means &#34;crumbs.&#34; Lebanese Chicken Fatteh includes chickpeas, toasted pita bread (I toss it with some olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper), shredded. Freekeh, toasted pinenuts and almonds, chickpeas and topped with minted yoghurt sauce on a bed of crispy Lebanese bread. Layers of pita chips, white rice, and yogurt tahini sauce. Thin slices of beef steak with fried onions. It&#39;s a way to utilize old bread by using flavored broth to hydrate stale bread or fry the This is Fattet Magdus, it&#39;s hard to choose my favorite fatteh, but this is definitely one of them.
