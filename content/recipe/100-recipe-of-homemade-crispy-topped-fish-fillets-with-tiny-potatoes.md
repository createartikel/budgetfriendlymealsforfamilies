The fish cooks up perfectly on top of its own side dish of crispy potatoes, and the whole thing is just beautiful to look at.

This fish is accompanied with crispy smashed potatoes, made super fast by cooking them in the microwave, smashing them (this is such a satisfying step!) then pan frying them with the fish to make it fabulously crispy.
