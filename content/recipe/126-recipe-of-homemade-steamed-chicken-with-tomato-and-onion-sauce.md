- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/3 tsp Salt and pepper B"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rub the salt and pepper A into the chicken thigh and place in a zipper bag. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes-1 hour. It is also all right to use shio-koji here instead."
- "Make the dressing while the meat in Step 1 is marinating."
- "Finely dice the onion. Soak in water and rinse, changing the water 5 or 6 times, to get rid of the spiciness."
- "When the white onion has turned a little transparent, try a little bit and see if the spiciness has gone. If it has, it is OK. This is easy if you use a sieve placed in a bowl filled with water."

- "Steam the chicken from Step 1 in a microwave steamer or regular steamer. It will take around 20 minutes to cook."
- "You can tell if it is cooked by pressing the surface - if it is hard it is done - but you can be sure by cutting the chicken in half. You will slice it later anyway. If there are any raw areas, steam it again."
- "When it is cooked, soak in ice-cold water for about 3 minutes. Remove the excess water and slice. Top with plenty of dressing from step 8 and the dish is complete."
