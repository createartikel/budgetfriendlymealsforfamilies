recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all the fruit mix ingredients the night before."
- "Extra credit cooks bonus! Grab two rocks glasses add an ice cube to each then pour the remaining apricot nectar into the glasses. In one glass add a shot of spiced rum and in the other add a shot of gran gala. Enjoy!"
- "Pre heat oven to 325."
- "Pull the fruit mix out of the refrigerator. Zest and juice the orange and the lemon. Add both juices to the fruit mix. Set zest aside."

- "Distribute the batter evenly between the 2 loaf pans. Tap them on the counter lightly to make sure the batter is settled on the bottom."
- "Bake for about an hour and a half. After an hour start checking them by putting a butter knife in the middle to see if it comes out clean."
- "When done let cool and turn them out onto a cutting board."
- "Once completely cooled move to a vessel large enough for both to have space around them and lid. We used a cake carrier."
- "You can eat right away, but we are going to wait at least two weeks. During this long wait we will be spritzing with spiced rum roughly every 3 days."
- "See not so scary!"
