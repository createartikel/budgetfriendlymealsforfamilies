Once upon a time, there was a Persian woman madly in love with a prince. To make him fall in love with her, she baked him this cake, filled with magical love powers. I got to know this cake from My Kitchen Rules (Australian TV show). I can comfortably say that this is not a cake of Persian origin, and I am not sure whether nutmeg is used in Persian sweets. Persian Love Cake is a guest recipe by Yasmin Khan so we are not able to answer questions regarding this recipe.
