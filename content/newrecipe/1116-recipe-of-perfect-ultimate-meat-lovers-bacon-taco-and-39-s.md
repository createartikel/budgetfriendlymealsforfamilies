- "3 tbsp milk"
- "1 tbsp bacon grease"
- "1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese"
- "3 dash ground black pepper"
- "1 anything else u would like to put in your scrambled eggs chorizo sausage onions green peppers mushrooms hot sauce etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "to pan fry: large skillet lightly greased.."
- "to oven cook.. preheat oven to 400°F"

- "trim off some excess bacon ( save for later use!)"
- "to oven cook: place parchment with weave in a cookie sheet and bake about 35-40 minutes or until nice and crispy! flipping halfway through. I do not like this method as the edges tend to burn before the middle is done."

I use medium high."
- "when done.. transfer bacon to a paper towel to drain. while bacon is still hot fold it in half resting it on something to keep the mouth of the taco open so u can fill it later. I used an oval 1/3c. measuring cup. u can use a handle of a large spoon or whatever."

- "heat same skillet u did veggies in.. add a tbl. of bacon grease and pour egg mix in. keep stirring and cook until scrambled eggs form and eggs are cooked through."
