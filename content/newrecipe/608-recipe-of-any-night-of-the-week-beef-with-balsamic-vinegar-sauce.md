I serve it on the side of beef or lamb grilled with very simple flavours, sometimes even with just salt and pepper. The glaze is thick and sweet and has the intense flavour of balsamic vinegar so it doubles. Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce it by half. Taste it - it will be very vinegary, but that&#39;s ok, don&#39;t worry. If the vegetables are swimming in liquid, reduce the liquid on the stovetop over medium-high heat.
