- "allow chicken to drain for at least 5 minutes."
- "if you got the weights and timing correct, the chicken will be a golden brown colour. too far and it will burn and go dark brown ala many of these other clone recipes"
- "you will now have kfc that you may remember eating as a child. their recipe has &#39;evolved&#39; now to include cheaper ingredients and so tastes different to how it used to. btw msg can be omitted but in small quantities it can enhance the taste of the spices to great effect."
