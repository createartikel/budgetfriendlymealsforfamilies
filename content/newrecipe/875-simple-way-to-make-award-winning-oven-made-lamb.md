- " Salt pepper and seasoning of your choice"
- " Lamb ribs as many as you choose"
- " Vegetables of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the ribs with seasoning of your choice and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Marinating works too. Salt, pepper, various herbs, curry powder, batter, there are so many possibilities."
- "Pre heat oven to 350 Fahrenheit (or 177 Celsius or 4 gas marks)"
- "Slice or cut vegetables. For hard ones like potatoes or sweet potatoes, it can be good to boil them to soften them up a bit. I enjoy onions, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes but again, the options depend on your creativity."
- "Lay it all out on an oven tray with foil on it. Make sure to apply oil or anti stick spray on the foil. I prefer olive oil, it doesn&#39;t have to be anything expensive. Making cuts in the lamb rib will help heat pass through evenly, especially for the thicker pieces."
- "Put it in the oven for a minimum of 10 minutes and then flip the ribs. Depending on what vegetables you&#39;re cooking and what size/thickness the meat is, the remaining time can vary. Remember to cook all the way through to avoid any post meal complications. You might have to remove the veggies earlier to make sure they don&#39;t burn if you use veggies that burn easily and also are using thick cuts of lamb."
- "Monitor until done and enjoy with rice, pasta, or dinner rolls!"
