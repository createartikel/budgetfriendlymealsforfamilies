Every time I see the snap of Black Forest Cake, I am so tempted to try it at home. But thinking about the richness of the cake and the calories, I just stay away from it. A Black Forest Cake would not be the same without the sour Morello cherries. These tart flavored cherries perfectly complement the rich chocolate flavor of the cake and the sweet whipped cream. I like to use the bottled dark mahogany red colored Morello Cherries that are packed in a light syrup.
