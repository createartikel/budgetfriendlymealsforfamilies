- "1/4 onion chopped"
- "1 clove garlic crushed"
- "3 regular sized mushrooms sliced"
- "1 tbsp oil"
- "500 grams minced beef"
- "1 can kidney beans"
- "1 can crushed tomatoes in juice"
- "1 beef flavour cube"
- "1/2 cup hot water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat pan on stove top with oil. Add onions, garlic and mushrooms and stir until onion goes soft and mushrooms start to change color."
- "Add the mince. You will need a wooden spoon to break up the large chunks of mince, so that it evenly browns."
- "Once the mince has turned brown, add the tomatoes, beans, flavour cube and hot water. Combine carefully to make sure the flavour cube disintegrates. Turn the heat to high until mince mixture boils. Then turn down to medium/low and let it simmer for about 10 - 15 minutes."

You can then top with grated cheese and grill in the oven until cheese melts. I like to have mine with sour cream and avocado. Enjoy!"
