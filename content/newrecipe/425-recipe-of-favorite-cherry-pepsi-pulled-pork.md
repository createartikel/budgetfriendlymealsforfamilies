First of all, who knew that it could be SO affordable to make this much food? I seriously think that using Pepsi to make a BBQ sauce is almost better than pouring it into a tall glass and guzzling it down! The way it thickens up and compliments. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper, and stir. Cola provides liquid to slow cook the pork until it&#39;s tender, plus it adds sweetness and flavor.
