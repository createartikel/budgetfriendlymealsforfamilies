If you&#39;re wanting to steam, boil, or cook food and don&#39;t have the room Make sure that they stand upright, so the bottom of them is down. This will balance out the yolks and be the ideal finish if you are making deviled eggs. Personally if im making egg fried rice, i boil the rice in water with a pinch of salt and a little splash of oil (vegtable or olive oil etc) and cook through as normal. Then drain the rice from water and if possible leave in the fridge overnight so it has time to dry. However I usually dont have time for this step.
