- "Add pecans to the trout pan and toast/brown for 1-2 minutes. Add oyster mushrooms, butter, and spices. Cook while stirring 3-4 minutes, or until tender. Add tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Push everything to one side, then return fish to the pan, skin-side up. Turn off the heat."
- "Add the grated Gouda and butter to the grits, stirring well to melt and combine, then adjust the consistency with a little more milk or water if needed. The grits should be viscous but should still “stand up” on the plate."
- "Top trout with the oyster mushroom and pecan mixture and serve alongside a helping of Gouda grits. Enjoy!"
