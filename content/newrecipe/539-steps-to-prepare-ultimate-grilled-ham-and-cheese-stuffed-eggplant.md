I love the cheese, ham and egg combo, so this recipe is on the menu for the weekend! Heat the grill (or stovetop grill pan) to high heat. Whisk together the olive oil and vinegar and lightly dunk the eggplant slices so each is moist with the oil. In the last couple minutes of cooking, sprinkle each eggplant slice with a few crumbles of goat cheese and cook so that the cheese begins to soften. Grilling eggplant makes for a quick and healthy side dish.
