Many people claim to have the true Maryland crab cake, but this one uses all lump meat with almost no filler added and tastes incredible! Having lived by the Chesapeake Bay on Kent Island, MD nearly my whole life, I was challenged to develop this authentic Maryland style crab cake about a year ago. Make the crab cakes first so they have time to firm up in the refrigerator before you cook them. Dip both sides of each crab cake into bread crumbs, pressing crumbs into cake with hands to completely cover; place on cookie sheet. For an extra crispy crab cake, turn on broiler for the last two minutes of baking.
