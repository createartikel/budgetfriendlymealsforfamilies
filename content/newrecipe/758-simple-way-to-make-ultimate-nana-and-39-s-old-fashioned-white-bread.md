recipeingredient:
- " packets active dry yeast or 4 12 tsp jarred yeast"
- " warm water about 100F"
- " milk  scalded then cooled to luke warm"
- " sugar  divided"
- " unsalted butter or shortening"
- " salt"
- " allpurpose flour"
- " Optional"
- " egg beaten or 4 tbs melted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "In the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a dough hook add water, yeast, and 1 tbs sugar. Stir gently, then allow to bloom untouched 5 minutes. Add scalded warm milk, remaining sugar, shortening, salt, and first 2 cups of flour."
- "Turn mixer on to lowest setting until ingredients are just combined. Increase to next speed. Begin adding additional flour 1/2 cup at a time until dough begins to pull away from bowl (mine took about 8 cups today, a rainy Winter day)."
- "As soon as dough pulls away stop adding flour and continue running mixer for 2 minutes more. If dough begins to climb hook shut off and scrape down slightly. Then start up again."
- "Transfer dough to a greased bowl. Turn once to coat. Cover with a lint free towel and allow to rise 1 hr in a warm spot (I turn my oven on to warm then sit the bowl on the back burner of the stovetop)."
- "When dough has risen punch down. Lightly grease 2 loaf pans. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 4 equal portions. Gently form each into a ball. Place 2 balls side by side in each loaf pan. Cover with towel and allow to rise 1 hr again."
- "After second proof preheat oven to 425°F. Do not punch down dough this time. If desired beat 1 egg OR melt butter and gently brush over the top of each loaf. Gently place pans in oven (careful not to bump pans or drop onto rack). Bake 20-30 minutes or until tops are browned."
- "Remove from oven. Let loaves cool 5 minutes in pans. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
- "To serve: Slice to desired thickness (1/2 thick is nice). Spread butter, jam/jelly, peanut butter, drizzle honey, etc. The toppings are endless for hearty homemade bread!"
- "See notes below ⤵"
- "Note 1: You can make this bread without a stand mixer. Mix all ingredients in same way as written above in a large bowl with a wooden spoon. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for 8 minutes. Continue with remaining steps from there."
- "Note 2: It is definitely important to scald the milk as it will contribute to a lighter bread texture. &#34;Scalding&#34; milk means to bring it nearly to a boil, then to allow it to cool back down."
- "Note 3: When forming balls, you are not actually rolling the dough into balls. Just pick up a section and gently manuever to shape a ball or your bread may end up too dense."
- "Note 4: Be EXTREMELY careful if brushing with egg or butter. Even the slightest excess pressure will cause a loaf to fall and not remain risen while baking. Sadly, this happened with one of my loaves today. No worries, if this happens the bread is still edible, it&#39;s just not as pretty. Lol"
