You would see men dressed in red with a tambourine in hand, on the streets of Iran. This man is called ‘ Haji Firooz’. His face covered in soot. They are singing and dancing on the streets and trying to cheer people and deliver the news that Nowruz in on the way."

According to folklore, uncle Nowruz appears annually at the beginning of Spring with his sidekick, Haji firooz. For Nowruz, we set a table which is called ‘ Haft seen’ or seven S’s. We decorate our table with seven items that start with letter ‘S’ in Farsi language and each item has symbolic meaning."

- "Iranians start celebration of Nowruz around 21th March, the time of the spring equinox. It does not matter if it is early morning, mid night, noon or after noon. People dress up new clothes, sit around the Haft seen table and wait for the exact moment of the spring arrival. And then family members hugs each other, kisses and gifts exchange. Then people start visit their family members or friends and neighbours."
- "Nowruz celebration lasts 12 days. During this period schools are closed and visiting family members, eating and drinking is main activity. The last day of Nowruz is celebrated on the 13th of Nowruz and as 13 is a bad luck number, for this reason people leaving their houses and spending the day in the nature.  So as we say in Farsi: Nowruz mobarak = Happy Nowruz"
