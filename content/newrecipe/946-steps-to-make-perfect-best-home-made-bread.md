recipeingredient:
- "3 tbsp yeast"
- "2 1/2 tbsp honey or 3 tbs white sugar"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "3 eggs"
- "3/4 cup melted coconut oil or canola vegetable or olive oil"
- "5 cup warm water"
- "6 cup whole wheat flour"
- "2 tbsp salt"
- "6 cup white flour 6 cups"
- "1 cup shredded flax seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yeast, honey and 1 cup warm water. Let stand for 10 minutes."
- "Add flax seeds, eggs, and oil and mix well."
- "Add 5 cups of warm water and whole wheat flour. Mix well."
- "Add salt and mix well."
- "Add white flour one cup at a time, mixing well each time. Add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is soft and kneadable."
- "Take dough and divide into six equal sections. Form a loaf with each section."
- "Place loafs in oiled loaf pans and poke a few holes in a nice pattern with a knife (this allows the dough to rise without forming air pockets)."
- "Cover with clean towel and let rise until at least doubled their size in a warm place. (Letting them sit for 7-10 minutes in the oven on &#34;warm&#34; setting, covered with a towel, will help them rise better). After the 7-10 minutes take them out and let them rise on the counter until they are the appropriate size."
- "Bake at 350°F until golden brown."
- "I always mix and knead the dough in my Bosch machine and then bake in the oven. Much easier and yields much fluffier bread."
- "After the bread is baked, take them out of the pans immediately and let cool. Slice the bread. Place loafs in ziploc bags. Because this recipe yields 6 loafs, I usually freeze 5 and just take them out as needed, defrosting and storing them in the refrigerator. Pop them in the toaster and they still taste fresh as ever. :)"
