recipeingredient:
- "1/3 cup white sugar"
- "1 cup brown sugar"
- "1/2 cup melted butter"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1 mediumsized egg"
- "2 1/2 cups AP flour"
- "1/2 cup milk chocolate bar cut into chunks"
- "1/2 cup dark chocolate cut into chunks"
- " Optional for a different kind of cookie"
- "1/2 cup white chocolate bar cut into chunks"
- "1/2 cup macadamia nuts slightly crushed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Let’s get started making these incredible cookies!"
- "First step is to combine both sugars and melted butter in a medium-sized bowl using a silicone spatula or a wooden mixing spoon."
- "Next, mix in the egg and vanilla."
- "Sift in the flour, baking soda, and salt; mix well."
- "This is your base cookie dough. Now is the perfect time to get creative with toppings! For this recipe I’ve chosen to make a traditional chocolate chunk cookie, and a white chocolate chunk cookie with macadamia nuts. Other topping options can be: m&amp;ms, crushed up Oreo cookies, or chocolate chips and pretzels."
- "(If you are going to a traditional chocolate chunk cookie recipe, the best way to cut your chocolate bars into chunks is just by using a sharp knife. Don’t worry about the chunks being even. Those uneven chocolate chunks will give you different size chocolate pockets which we all know and love in our cookies.)"
- "Add in your toppings to the cookie dough and mix well. Now I know it’s not recommended but YOLO so I always sample my raw cookie dough because who doesn’t like cookie dough? (Just don’t eat it all then and there!)"
- "Cover the bowl with Saran Wrap and chill in the fridge for a minimum of one hour."
- "Pro tip: The longer your cookie dough chills, the more intense and complex the flavor will be. Some bakeries let their cookie dough chill for 24hrs or more! But, if you don’t have the patience to do that —like me—chill for at least an hour and you will still get an incredible cookie packed with flavor."
- "After chilling for an hour; preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit)."
- "Using a cookie scoop, place your cookie dough balls on a tray about 2” from each other. Bake for 14-17 minutes, or until golden brown."
- "Remove from oven and let it cool for at least 15-20 minutes. If you have enough self control, wait to serve until the cookies have cooled completely for the best texture."
- "Perfect for dipping in milk or coffee, or being served with vanilla ice cream!"
